### ⚠️ Deployment Considerations:
- **Firebase Setup**: You'll need to configure Firebase environment variables

- **Database**: Ensure Firestore is properly configured for production
- **Domain**: Consider custom domain for professional appearance

## 🚀 Quick Start - Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod

   - API keys
   - Any other secrets
