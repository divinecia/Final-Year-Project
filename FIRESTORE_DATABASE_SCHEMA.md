## Schema Compliance Features

### Data Structure Alignment
- ✅ All collections use standardized field names
- ✅ Nested objects properly structured (personalInfo, workProfile, etc.)
- ✅ Consistent timestamp handling (createdAt, updatedAt)
- ✅ Proper status field standardization

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Fallback queries for old data structures
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing schema fields
- ✅ Progressive migration support

### Type Safety

- ✅ Proper error handling for schema mismatches

### Compatibility Testing
- ✅ Old data structures still supported via fallbacks
- ✅ New data structures properly implemented
- ✅ Migration path validated

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Data Consistency
- Standardized field names across all collections
- Consistent data types and structures
- Proper relationship modeling

### 2. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns in data organization
- Easier debugging with structured field access
- Better code organization with schema alignment

### 3. Scalability
- Optimized query patterns for better performance
- Proper indexing strategy aligned with access patterns
